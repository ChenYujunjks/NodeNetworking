# Node Networking Project

This project explores the core functionalities of Node.js's `net`, `fs`, and `url` modules through a series of practical experiments. Each experiment is encapsulated within a separate `.mjs` file, allowing for targeted study and experimentation with each module's specific capabilities.

## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get the project up and running on your local machine for development and experimentation purposes.

### Prerequisites

- Ensure you have Node.js installed on your system. Visit [Node.js official website](https://nodejs.org/) for installation instructions.

## Overview of Experiments

- **netExperiments**: Dive into the `net` module with experiments like a basic TCP server and an echo server to understand TCP/IP networking.
- **fsExperiments**: Explore the `fs` module with tasks such as reading from and writing to files, to grasp file system operations.
- **urlExperiments**: Unpack the `url` module by parsing and constructing URLs, which is crucial for web development and HTTP communication.
